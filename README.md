# Vending-Machine project using 8051 microcontroller
  The development of the vending machine project utilizing the 8051 microcontroller successfully demonstrates an automated system capable of dispensing
snacks based on coin detection. The integration of IR sensors, motor drivers,
and HC-05 Bluetooth module showcases the practical application of embedded systems and highlights the seamless communication between hardware
and software components. The inclusion of wireless communication via the
HC-05 module further enhances functionality, allowing for remote monitoring and control.
  This project addresses a practical problem, particularly for night canteens in hostel premises, offering a reliable, cost-effective, and user-friendly
solution. Throughout the design, simulation (using Proteus), and implementation phases, valuable technical insights were gained, particularly in
microcontroller programming, sensor interfacing, and Serial communication
protocols.
